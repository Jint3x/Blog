      As a developer, I’ve always asked myself ‘how?’. In a world, where things just keep getting more complex and difficult to learn, I want to create a place, a community where even the most complex things about technology and programming are explored in depth and fundametally understood. The first step towards achieving this goal, is this website. Here, I will try to go very in depth and explain many and different subjects about computers and programming.
